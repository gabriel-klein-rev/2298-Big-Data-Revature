# Project 1 
A Python application that connects to either a MySQL or MongoDB server,
and performs CRUD operations on a database. The functionality of the application is up to you besides the requirements listed below. Here are a few suggestions:
- Journal app
- Banking app
- Business management system
- Simple text-based game
- Productivity tool
- ...?


## Application Requirements
- CLI where users can interact with the application while it is running
- Application should handle Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality with a database
- Database should use at least 3 tables/documents
- The application must have a login feature, as well as user/admin roles
- All user input should be validated (program should not end with exceptions based on user input)
- Logging of events should be implemented (connecting to db, interacting with db/files, etc.)
- Program must follow OOP design (classes/objects)
- Application should be uploaded to a GitHub repository


Some admin features that you may want to implement: modifying inventory, removing/editing users,
granting admin access to specific users...

## Tech Stack:
- Python 3.x
- VS Code
- MySQL / MongoDB
- Git

## Presentation:
We will present our projects the morning of October 14, 2025.

Short ~5 minute demonstration of all the functionalities of your project.

Please create a short slide show that explains the project and tech stack (example to follow).

The bulk of the presentation will be demonstrating the application itself.

## Other things of note:
This is an individual assignment, no groups.
You will be expected to back up your project using GitHub in case of any system crashes or data loss.

Use these Git commands frequently:

    git status
    git add .
    git commit -m 'message'
    git push

## Proposal:
I will meet with you individually on Tuesday, October 7 to go over your idea of your project.
