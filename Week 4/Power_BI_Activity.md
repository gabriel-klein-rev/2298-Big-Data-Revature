# Power BI Activity

## Goal

Practice using Power BI. 

## Description

You are given one csv file:

-   inu_neku_orderline_clean.csv

-   (Details about data can be found here):
    <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alicert/ecommerce-online-sales-data-frame>

Load this data into Power BI. Check for any formatting
issues and fix if necessary. 

Once complete, you will create a report with visualizations
answering these questions (Take a look at the various types of graphs to
best answer these. Show a good variety of charts):

1)  How have sales compared by month from Jan 2021 -- Jun 2021?

2)  How do sales compare throughout the day? (Morning, midday, evening, define how you would like) 

3)  What products are selling the most?

4)  Where (physical location) are most of the customers?

5)  What age groups do we see the most sales?

6)  How much has the average customer spent throughout Jan 2021 -- Jun
    2021?

7)  (bonus points for finding any other interesting trends/patterns)
