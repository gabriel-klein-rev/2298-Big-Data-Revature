# Hive Activity 2

Complete the following activity to practice loading data from files into Hive tables and querying with HiveQL.

### Steps
1. Using the supplied [players.csv](./players.csv) file, create a Hive table called players and load it with the csv data.
    - Note that the csv file has a header.
2. Make the following queries on the "players" table and create new tables from the queries:
    - The average age of players on each team.
    - The maximum and minimum height of players in the "Catcher" position.
    - The number of players at each position whose age is younger than 25.
    - All teams that contain at least 35 players, in alphabetical order.
3. Note where these tables are saved on HDFS.
